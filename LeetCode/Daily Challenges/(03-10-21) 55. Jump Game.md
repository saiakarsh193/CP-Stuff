# 55. Jump Game  

- Ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/  
- Time: `O(N)`  
- Space: `O(1)`  
- We traverse from the end to the start by keeping the end as current position. If we can find an index which can reach the current position, then we jump to that index and make it the current position and repeat the process till we reach the first index. If no index can reach this position, it means that this position cannot be landed upon. Lets assume there is some other alternative route which actually reaches the end. But if you are able to reach the end, we should be able to reach every position in the array (by reducing the jump value appropriately). Since we are not able to reach this position from any index, it means there is no valid path to reach the end. Hence no jump route is possible.

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        cur = len(nums) - 1
        for i in reversed(range(len(nums) - 1)):
            if(nums[i] >= cur - i):
                cur = i
        if(cur == 0):
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
